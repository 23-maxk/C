You are a senior developer helping me fix and run this CRM web app. The app was uploaded from GitHub and includes React files in a folder called "project2".

Goals:
1. Fix any folder or file issues (e.g. spaces in folder names).
2. Ensure `npm install` installs all dependencies without error.
3. Run the app using `npm run dev` inside the correct project folder.
4. Make sure the main dashboard and estimate editor work.
5. Help me set up or edit contact/job data using forms in the app.

If anything breaks, show me how to fix it step by step in plain language â€” assume I have zero coding knowledge.

Start by:
- Going into the `project2` folder
- Installing dependencies
- Running the app
